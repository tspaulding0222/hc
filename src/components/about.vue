            During a moment in time when 4th generation warfare is the norm for all citizens, it makes sense to go armed. While 
            any number of weapons are superior in power and accuracy to the handgun, no other gun is as easy to carry and have 
            with you at all times. This is why Handgun Combatives concentrates on the handgun in its training coursesâ€¦it is the 
            weapon you are likely to have with you at all times. The first rule of gunfighting is to have a gun and the handgun
            is the one you are most likely to have when danger presents itself.
